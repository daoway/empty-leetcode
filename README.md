Tests and solutions for non-premium LeetCode tasks in Java

## Solutions
Some of the tasks solved, it's for my own fun and joy. Solution.java has name and description of the task, SolutionTest.java - test generated from provieded examples.

## Tests
For majority of the tasks project has a unit test. Except for design related quesions, where it's not possible to generate it from provided examples, etc.. All this tests were scrapped from the web, then code generated from LC description. It means there could be errors, beacause parsing is a bitch. Threfore, most of the time, it's OK.
