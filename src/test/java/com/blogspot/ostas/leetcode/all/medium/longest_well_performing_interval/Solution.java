https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-well-performing-interval

We are given hours, a list of the number of hours worked per day for a given employee.
A day is considered to be a tiring day if and only if the number of hours worked is (strictly) greater than 8.
A well-performing interval is an interval of days for which the number of tiring days is strictly larger than the number of non-tiring days.
Return the length of the longest well-performing interval.
