      2044. count number of maximum bitwise-or subsets

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-maximum-bitwise-or-subsets

Given an integer array nums, find the maximum possible bitwise OR of a subset of nums and return the number of different non-empty subsets with the maximum bitwise OR.
An array a is a subset of an array b if a can be obtained from b by deleting some (possibly zero) elements of b. Two subsets are considered different if the indices of the elements chosen are different.
The bitwise OR of an array a is equal to a[0] OR a[1] OR ... OR a[a.length - 1] (0-indexed).
