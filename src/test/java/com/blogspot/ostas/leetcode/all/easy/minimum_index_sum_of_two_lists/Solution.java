Given two arrays of strings list1 and list2, find the common strings with the least index sum.
A common string is a string that appeared in both list1 and list2.
A common string with the least index sum is a common string such that if it appeared at list1[i] and list2[j] then i + j should be the minimum value among all the other common strings.
Return all the common strings with the least index sum. Return the answer in any order.
