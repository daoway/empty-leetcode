      Example 1:
    Input: grid = [[0,2],[1,3]]
    Output: 3
    Explanation:
    At time 0, you are in grid location (0, 0).
    You cannot go anywhere else because 4-directionally adjacent neighbors have a higher elevation than t = 0.
    You cannot reach point (1, 1) until time 3.
    When the depth of water is 3, we can swim anywhere inside the grid.
    Example 2:
    Input: grid = [[0,1,2,3,4],[24,23,22,21,5],[12,13,14,15,16],[11,17,18,19,20],[10,9,8,7,6]]
    Output: 16
    Explanation: The final route is shown.
    We need to wait until time 16 so that (0, 0) and (4, 4) are connected.
      Constraints:
    n == grid.length
    n == grid[i].length
    1 <= n <= 50
    0 <= grid[i][j] < n2
    Each value grid[i][j] is unique.
