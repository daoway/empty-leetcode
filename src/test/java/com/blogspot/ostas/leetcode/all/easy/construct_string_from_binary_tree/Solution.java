https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-string-from-binary-tree

Given the root of a binary tree, construct a string consisting of parenthesis and integers from a binary tree with the preorder traversal way, and return it.
Omit all the empty parenthesis pairs that do not affect the one-to-one mapping relationship between the string and the original binary tree.
