      2828. check if a string is an acronym of words

https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-a-string-is-an-acronym-of-words

Given an array of strings words and a string s, determine if s is an acronym of words.
The string s is considered an acronym of words if it can be formed by concatenating the first character of each string in words in order. For example, "ab" can be formed from ["apple", "banana"], but it can't be formed from ["bear", "aardvark"].
Return true if s is an acronym of words, and false otherwise.
