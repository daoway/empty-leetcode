      Example 1:
    Pass Number Sender ID Receiver ID x + Receiver IDs
      2
    1 2 1 3
    2 1 0 3
    3 0 2 5
    4 2 1 6
    Input: receiver = [2,0,1], k = 4
    Output: 6
    Explanation: The table above shows a simulation of the game starting with the player having id x = 2.
    From the table, f(2) is equal to 6.
    It can be shown that 6 is the maximum achievable value of the function.
    Hence, the output is 6.
    Example 2:
    Pass Number Sender ID Receiver ID x + Receiver IDs
      4
    1 4 3 7
    2 3 2 9
    3 2 1 10
    Input: receiver = [1,1,1,2,3], k = 3
    Output: 10
    Explanation: The table above shows a simulation of the game starting with the player having id x = 4.
    From the table, f(4) is equal to 10.
    It can be shown that 10 is the maximum achievable value of the function.
    Hence, the output is 10.
      Constraints:
    1 <= receiver.length == n <= 105
    0 <= receiver[i] <= n - 1
    1 <= k <= 1010
