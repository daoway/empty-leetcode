      2813. maximum elegance of a k-length subsequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-elegance-of-a-k-length-subsequence

You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array items of length n and an integer k.
items[i] = [profiti, categoryi], where profiti and categoryi denote the profit and category of the ith item respectively.
Let's define the elegance of a subsequence of items as total_profit + distinct_categories2, where total_profit is the sum of all profits in the subsequence, and distinct_categories is the number of distinct categories from all the categories in the selected subsequence.
Your task is to find the maximum elegance from all subsequences of size k in items.
Return an integer denoting the maximum elegance of a subsequence of items with size exactly k.
Note: A subsequence of an array is a new array generated from the original array by deleting some elements (possibly none) without changing the remaining elements' relative order.
