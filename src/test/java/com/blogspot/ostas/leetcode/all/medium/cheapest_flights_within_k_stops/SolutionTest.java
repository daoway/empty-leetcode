      Example 1:
    Input: n = 4, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[2,0,100],[1,3,600],[2,3,200]], src = 0, dst = 3, k = 1
    Output: 700
    Explanation:
    The graph is shown above.
    The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 3 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 600 = 700.
    Note that the path through cities [0,1,2,3] is cheaper but is invalid because it uses 2 stops.
    Example 2:
    Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 1
    Output: 200
    Explanation:
    The graph is shown above.
    The optimal path with at most 1 stop from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 100 + 100 = 200.
    Example 3:
    Input: n = 3, flights = [[0,1,100],[1,2,100],[0,2,500]], src = 0, dst = 2, k = 0
    Output: 500
    Explanation:
    The graph is shown above.
    The optimal path with no stops from city 0 to 2 is marked in red and has cost 500.
      Constraints:
    1 <= n <= 100
    0 <= flights.length <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)
    flights[i].length == 3
    0 <= fromi, toi < n
    fromi != toi
    1 <= pricei <= 104
    There will not be any multiple flights between two cities.
    0 <= src, dst, k < n
    src != dst
