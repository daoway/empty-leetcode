      919. complete binary tree inserter

https://leetcode.com/problems/complete-binary-tree-inserter

A complete binary tree is a binary tree in which every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.
Design an algorithm to insert a new node to a complete binary tree keeping it complete after the insertion.
Implement the CBTInserter class:
CBTInserter(TreeNode root) Initializes the data structure with the root of the complete binary tree.
int insert(int v) Inserts a TreeNode into the tree with value Node.val == val so that the tree remains complete, and returns the value of the parent of the inserted TreeNode.
TreeNode get_root() Returns the root node of the tree.
