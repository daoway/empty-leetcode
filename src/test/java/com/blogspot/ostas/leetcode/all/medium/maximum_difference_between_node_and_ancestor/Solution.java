      1026. maximum difference between node and ancestor

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-difference-between-node-and-ancestor

Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value v for which there exist different nodes a and b where v = |a.val - b.val| and a is an ancestor of b.
A node a is an ancestor of b if either: any child of a is equal to b or any child of a is an ancestor of b.
