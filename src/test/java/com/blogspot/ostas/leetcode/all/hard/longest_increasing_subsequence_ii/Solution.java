      2407. longest increasing subsequence ii

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence-ii

You are given an integer array nums and an integer k.
Find the longest subsequence of nums that meets the following requirements:
The subsequence is strictly increasing and
The difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence is at most k.
Return the length of the longest subsequence that meets the requirements.
A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
