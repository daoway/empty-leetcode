      2825. make string a subsequence using cyclic increments

https://leetcode.com/problems/make-string-a-subsequence-using-cyclic-increments

You are given two 0-indexed strings str1 and str2.
In an operation, you select a set of indices in str1, and for each index i in the set, increment str1[i] to the next character cyclically. That is 'a' becomes 'b', 'b' becomes 'c', and so on, and 'z' becomes 'a'.
Return true if it is possible to make str2 a subsequence of str1 by performing the operation at most once, and false otherwise.
Note: A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (possibly none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters.
