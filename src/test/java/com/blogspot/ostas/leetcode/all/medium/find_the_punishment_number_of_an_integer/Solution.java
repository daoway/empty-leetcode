Given a positive integer n, return the punishment number of n.
The punishment number of n is defined as the sum of the squares of all integers i such that:
1 <= i <= n
The decimal representation of i * i can be partitioned into contiguous substrings such that the sum of the integer values of these substrings equals i.
