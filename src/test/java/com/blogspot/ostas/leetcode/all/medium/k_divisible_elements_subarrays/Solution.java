      2261. k divisible elements subarrays

https://leetcode.com/problems/k-divisible-elements-subarrays

Given an integer array nums and two integers k and p, return the number of distinct subarrays, which have at most k elements that are divisible by p.
Two arrays nums1 and nums2 are said to be distinct if:
They are of different lengths, or
There exists at least one index i where nums1[i] != nums2[i].
A subarray is defined as a non-empty contiguous sequence of elements in an array.
