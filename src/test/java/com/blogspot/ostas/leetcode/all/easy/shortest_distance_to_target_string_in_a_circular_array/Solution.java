      2515. shortest distance to target string in a circular array

https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-distance-to-target-string-in-a-circular-array

You are given a 0-indexed circular string array words and a string target. A circular array means that the array's end connects to the array's beginning.
Formally, the next element of words[i] is words[(i + 1) % n] and the previous element of words[i] is words[(i - 1 + n) % n], where n is the length of words.
Starting from startIndex, you can move to either the next word or the previous word with 1 step at a time.
Return the shortest distance needed to reach the string target. If the string target does not exist in words, return -1.

class Solution {
  public int closetTarget(String[] words, String target, int startIndex) {
    return 0;
