      1432. max difference you can get from changing an integer

https://leetcode.com/problems/max-difference-you-can-get-from-changing-an-integer

You are given an integer num. You will apply the following steps exactly two times:
Pick a digit x (0 <= x <= 9).
Pick another digit y (0 <= y <= 9). The digit y can be equal to x.
Replace all the occurrences of x in the decimal representation of num by y.
The new integer cannot have any leading zeros, also the new integer cannot be 0.
Let a and b be the results of applying the operations to num the first and second times, respectively.
Return the max difference between a and b.
