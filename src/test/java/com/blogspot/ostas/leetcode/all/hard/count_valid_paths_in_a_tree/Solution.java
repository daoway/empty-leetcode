      2867. count valid paths in a tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-valid-paths-in-a-tree

There is an undirected tree with n nodes labeled from 1 to n. You are given the integer n and a 2D integer array edges of length n - 1, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is an edge between nodes ui and vi in the tree.
Return the number of valid paths in the tree.
A path (a, b) is valid if there exists exactly one prime number among the node labels in the path from a to b.
Note that:
The path (a, b) is a sequence of distinct nodes starting with node a and ending with node b such that every two adjacent nodes in the sequence share an edge in the tree.
Path (a, b) and path (b, a) are considered the same and counted only once.
