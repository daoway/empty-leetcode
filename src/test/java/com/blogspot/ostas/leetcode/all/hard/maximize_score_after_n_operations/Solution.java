https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-score-after-n-operations

You are given nums, an array of positive integers of size 2 * n. You must perform n operations on this array.
In the ith operation (1-indexed), you will:
Choose two elements, x and y.
Receive a score of i * gcd(x, y).
Remove x and y from nums.
Return the maximum score you can receive after performing n operations.
The function gcd(x, y) is the greatest common divisor of x and y.
