      1455. check if a word occurs as a prefix of any word in a sentence

https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-a-word-occurs-as-a-prefix-of-any-word-in-a-sentence

Given a sentence that consists of some words separated by a single space, and a searchWord, check if searchWord is a prefix of any word in sentence.
Return the index of the word in sentence (1-indexed) where searchWord is a prefix of this word. If searchWord is a prefix of more than one word, return the index of the first word (minimum index). If there is no such word return -1.
A prefix of a string s is any leading contiguous substring of s.
