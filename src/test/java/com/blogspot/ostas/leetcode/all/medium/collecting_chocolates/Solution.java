https://leetcode.com/problems/collecting-chocolates

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of size n representing the cost of collecting different chocolates. The cost of collecting the chocolate at the index i is nums[i]. Each chocolate is of a different type, and initially, the chocolate at the index i is of ith type.
In one operation, you can do the following with an incurred cost of x:
Simultaneously change the chocolate of ith type to ((i + 1) mod n)th type for all chocolates.
Return the minimum cost to collect chocolates of all types, given that you can perform as many operations as you would like.
