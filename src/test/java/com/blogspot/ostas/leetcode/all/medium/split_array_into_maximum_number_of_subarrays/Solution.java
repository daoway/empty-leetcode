      2871. split array into maximum number of subarrays

https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-into-maximum-number-of-subarrays

You are given an array nums consisting of non-negative integers.
We define the score of subarray nums[l..r] such that l <= r as nums[l] AND nums[l + 1] AND ... AND nums[r] where AND is the bitwise AND operation.
Consider splitting the array into one or more subarrays such that the following conditions are satisfied:
Each element of the array belongs to exactly one subarray.
The sum of scores of the subarrays is the minimum possible.
Return the maximum number of subarrays in a split that satisfies the conditions above.
A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.
