      958. check completeness of a binary tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/check-completeness-of-a-binary-tree

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.
In a complete binary tree, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.
