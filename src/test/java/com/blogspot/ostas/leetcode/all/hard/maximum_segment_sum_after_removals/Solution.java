      2382. maximum segment sum after removals

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-segment-sum-after-removals

You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums and removeQueries, both of length n. For the ith query, the element in nums at the index removeQueries[i] is removed, splitting nums into different segments.
A segment is a contiguous sequence of positive integers in nums. A segment sum is the sum of every element in a segment.
Return an integer array answer, of length n, where answer[i] is the maximum segment sum after applying the ith removal.
Note: The same index will not be removed more than once.
