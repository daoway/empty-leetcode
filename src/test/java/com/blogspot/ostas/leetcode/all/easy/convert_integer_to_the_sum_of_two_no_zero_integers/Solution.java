      1317. convert integer to the sum of two no-zero integers

https://leetcode.com/problems/convert-integer-to-the-sum-of-two-no-zero-integers

No-Zero integer is a positive integer that does not contain any 0 in its decimal representation.
Given an integer n, return a list of two integers [a, b] where:
a and b are No-Zero integers.
a + b = n
The test cases are generated so that there is at least one valid solution. If there are many valid solutions, you can return any of them.
