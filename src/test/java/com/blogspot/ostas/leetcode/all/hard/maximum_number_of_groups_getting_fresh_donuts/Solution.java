      1815. maximum number of groups getting fresh donuts

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-groups-getting-fresh-donuts

There is a donuts shop that bakes donuts in batches of batchSize. They have a rule where they must serve all of the donuts of a batch before serving any donuts of the next batch. You are given an integer batchSize and an integer array groups, where groups[i] denotes that there is a group of groups[i] customers that will visit the shop. Each customer will get exactly one donut.
When a group visits the shop, all customers of the group must be served before serving any of the following groups. A group will be happy if they all get fresh donuts. That is, the first customer of the group does not receive a donut that was left over from the previous group.
You can freely rearrange the ordering of the groups. Return the maximum possible number of happy groups after rearranging the groups.
