https://leetcode.com/problems/jump-game-vii

You are given a 0-indexed binary string s and two integers minJump and maxJump. In the beginning, you are standing at index 0, which is equal to '0'. You can move from index i to index j if the following conditions are fulfilled:
i + minJump <= j <= min(i + maxJump, s.length - 1), and
s[j] == '0'.
Return true if you can reach index s.length - 1 in s, or false otherwise.

class Solution {
  public boolean canReach(String s, int minJump, int maxJump) {
    return false;
