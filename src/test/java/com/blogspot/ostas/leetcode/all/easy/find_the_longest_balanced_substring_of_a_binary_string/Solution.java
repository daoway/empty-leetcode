      2609. find the longest balanced substring of a binary string

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-longest-balanced-substring-of-a-binary-string

You are given a binary string s consisting only of zeroes and ones.
A substring of s is considered balanced if all zeroes are before ones and the number of zeroes is equal to the number of ones inside the substring. Notice that the empty substring is considered a balanced substring.
Return the length of the longest balanced substring of s.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
