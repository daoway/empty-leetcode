      1123. lowest common ancestor of deepest leaves

https://leetcode.com/problems/lowest-common-ancestor-of-deepest-leaves

Given the root of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.
Recall that:
The node of a binary tree is a leaf if and only if it has no children
The depth of the root of the tree is 0. if the depth of a node is d, the depth of each of its children is d + 1.
The lowest common ancestor of a set S of nodes, is the node A with the largest depth such that every node in S is in the subtree with root A.
