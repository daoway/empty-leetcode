      2745. construct the longest new string

https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-the-longest-new-string

You are given three integers x, y, and z.
You have x strings equal to "AA", y strings equal to "BB", and z strings equal to "AB". You want to choose some (possibly all or none) of these strings and concatenate them in some order to form a new string. This new string must not contain "AAA" or "BBB" as a substring.
Return the maximum possible length of the new string.
A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.
