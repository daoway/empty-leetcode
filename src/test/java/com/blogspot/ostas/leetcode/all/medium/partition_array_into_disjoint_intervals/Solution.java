      915. partition array into disjoint intervals

https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-into-disjoint-intervals

Given an integer array nums, partition it into two (contiguous) subarrays left and right so that:
Every element in left is less than or equal to every element in right.
left and right are non-empty.
left has the smallest possible size.
Return the length of left after such a partitioning.
Test cases are generated such that partitioning exists.
