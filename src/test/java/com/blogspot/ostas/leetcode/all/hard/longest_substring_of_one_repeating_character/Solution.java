      2213. longest substring of one repeating character

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-substring-of-one-repeating-character

You are given a 0-indexed string s. You are also given a 0-indexed string queryCharacters of length k and a 0-indexed array of integer indices queryIndices of length k, both of which are used to describe k queries.
The ith query updates the character in s at index queryIndices[i] to the character queryCharacters[i].
Return an array lengths of length k where lengths[i] is the length of the longest substring of s consisting of only one repeating character after the ith query is performed.
