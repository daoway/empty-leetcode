      2592. maximize greatness of an array

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximize-greatness-of-an-array

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. You are allowed to permute nums into a new array perm of your choosing.
We define the greatness of nums be the number of indices 0 <= i < nums.length for which perm[i] > nums[i].
Return the maximum possible greatness you can achieve after permuting nums.
