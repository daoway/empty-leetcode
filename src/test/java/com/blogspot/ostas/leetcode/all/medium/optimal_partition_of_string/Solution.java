https://leetcode.com/problems/optimal-partition-of-string

Given a string s, partition the string into one or more substrings such that the characters in each substring are unique. That is, no letter appears in a single substring more than once.
Return the minimum number of substrings in such a partition.
Note that each character should belong to exactly one substring in a partition.
