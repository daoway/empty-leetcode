      2318. number of distinct roll sequences

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-distinct-roll-sequences

You are given an integer n. You roll a fair 6-sided dice n times. Determine the total number of distinct sequences of rolls possible such that the following conditions are satisfied:
The greatest common divisor of any adjacent values in the sequence is equal to 1.
There is at least a gap of 2 rolls between equal valued rolls. More formally, if the value of the ith roll is equal to the value of the jth roll, then abs(i - j) > 2.
Return the total number of distinct sequences possible. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
Two sequences are considered distinct if at least one element is different.
