      60. permutation sequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/permutation-sequence

The set [1, 2, 3, ..., n] contains a total of n! unique permutations.
By listing and labeling all of the permutations in order, we get the following sequence for n = 3:
"123"
"132"
"213"
"231"
"312"
"321"
Given n and k, return the kth permutation sequence.
