      2834. find the minimum possible sum of a beautiful array

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-minimum-possible-sum-of-a-beautiful-array

You are given positive integers n and target.
An array nums is beautiful if it meets the following conditions:
nums.length == n.
nums consists of pairwise distinct positive integers.
There doesn't exist two distinct indices, i and j, in the range [0, n - 1], such that nums[i] + nums[j] == target.
Return the minimum possible sum that a beautiful array could have modulo 109 + 7.
