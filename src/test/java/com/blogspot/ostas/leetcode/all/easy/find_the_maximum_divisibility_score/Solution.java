      2644. find the maximum divisibility score

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-maximum-divisibility-score

You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums and divisors.
The divisibility score of divisors[i] is the number of indices j such that nums[j] is divisible by divisors[i].
Return the integer divisors[i] with the maximum divisibility score. If there is more than one integer with the maximum score, return the minimum of them.
