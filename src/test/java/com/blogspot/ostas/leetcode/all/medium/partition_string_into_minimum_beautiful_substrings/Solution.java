      2767. partition string into minimum beautiful substrings

https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-string-into-minimum-beautiful-substrings

Given a binary string s, partition the string into one or more substrings such that each substring is beautiful.
A string is beautiful if:
It doesn't contain leading zeros.
It's the binary representation of a number that is a power of 5.
Return the minimum number of substrings in such partition. If it is impossible to partition the string s into beautiful substrings, return -1.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.
