https://leetcode.com/problems/closest-prime-numbers-in-range

Given two positive integers left and right, find the two integers num1 and num2 such that:
left <= num1 < num2 <= right .
num1 and num2 are both prime numbers.
num2 - num1 is the minimum amongst all other pairs satisfying the above conditions.
Return the positive integer array ans = [num1, num2]. If there are multiple pairs satisfying these conditions, return the one with the minimum num1 value or [-1, -1] if such numbers do not exist.
A number greater than 1 is called prime if it is only divisible by 1 and itself.
