      1805. number of different integers in a string

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-different-integers-in-a-string

You are given a string word that consists of digits and lowercase English letters.
You will replace every non-digit character with a space. For example, "a123bc34d8ef34" will become " 123  34 8  34". Notice that you are left with some integers that are separated by at least one space: "123", "34", "8", and "34".
Return the number of different integers after performing the replacement operations on word.
Two integers are considered different if their decimal representations without any leading zeros are different.
