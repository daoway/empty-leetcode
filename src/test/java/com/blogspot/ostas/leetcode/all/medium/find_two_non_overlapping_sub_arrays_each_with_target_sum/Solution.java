      1477. find two non-overlapping sub-arrays each with target sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-two-non-overlapping-sub-arrays-each-with-target-sum

You are given an array of integers arr and an integer target.
You have to find two non-overlapping sub-arrays of arr each with a sum equal target. There can be multiple answers so you have to find an answer where the sum of the lengths of the two sub-arrays is minimum.
Return the minimum sum of the lengths of the two required sub-arrays, or return -1 if you cannot find such two sub-arrays.

  public int minSumOfLengths(int[] arr, int target) {
    return 0;
