      1325. delete leaves with a given value

https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-leaves-with-a-given-value

Given a binary tree root and an integer target, delete all the leaf nodes with value target.
Note that once you delete a leaf node with value target, if its parent node becomes a leaf node and has the value target, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you cannot).
