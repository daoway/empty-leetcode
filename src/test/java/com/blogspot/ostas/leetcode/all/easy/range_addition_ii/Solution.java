      598. range addition ii

https://leetcode.com/problems/range-addition-ii

You are given an m x n matrix M initialized with all 0's and an array of operations ops, where ops[i] = [ai, bi] means M[x][y] should be incremented by one for all 0 <= x < ai and 0 <= y < bi.
Count and return the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations.

  public int maxCount(int m, int n, int[][] ops) {
    return 0;
