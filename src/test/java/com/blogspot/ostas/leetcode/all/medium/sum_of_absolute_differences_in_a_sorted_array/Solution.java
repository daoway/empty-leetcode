      1685. sum of absolute differences in a sorted array

https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-absolute-differences-in-a-sorted-array

You are given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order.
Build and return an integer array result with the same length as nums such that result[i] is equal to the summation of absolute differences between nums[i] and all the other elements in the array.
In other words, result[i] is equal to sum(|nums[i]-nums[j]|) where 0 <= j < nums.length and j != i (0-indexed).
