https://leetcode.com/problems/count-zero-request-servers

You are given an integer n denoting the total number of servers and a 2D 0-indexed integer array logs, where logs[i] = [server_id, time] denotes that the server with id server_id received a request at time time.
You are also given an integer x and a 0-indexed integer array queries.
Return a 0-indexed integer array arr of length queries.length where arr[i] represents the number of servers that did not receive any requests during the time interval [queries[i] - x, queries[i]].
Note that the time intervals are inclusive.
