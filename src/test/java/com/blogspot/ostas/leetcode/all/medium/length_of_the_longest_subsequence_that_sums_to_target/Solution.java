      2915. length of the longest subsequence that sums to target

https://leetcode.com/problems/length-of-the-longest-subsequence-that-sums-to-target

You are given a 0-indexed array of integers nums, and an integer target.
Return the length of the longest subsequence of nums that sums up to target. If no such subsequence exists, return -1.
A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
