      990. satisfiability of equality equations

https://leetcode.com/problems/satisfiability-of-equality-equations

You are given an array of strings equations that represent relationships between variables where each string equations[i] is of length 4 and takes one of two different forms: "xi==yi" or "xi!=yi".Here, xi and yi are lowercase letters (not necessarily different) that represent one-letter variable names.
Return true if it is possible to assign integers to variable names so as to satisfy all the given equations, or false otherwise.
