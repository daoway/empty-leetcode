      2486. append characters to string to make subsequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/append-characters-to-string-to-make-subsequence

You are given two strings s and t consisting of only lowercase English letters.
Return the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end of s so that t becomes a subsequence of s.
A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
