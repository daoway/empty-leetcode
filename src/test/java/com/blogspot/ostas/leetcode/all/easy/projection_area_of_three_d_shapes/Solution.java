      883. projection area of 3d shapes

https://leetcode.com/problems/projection-area-of-3d-shapes

You are given an n x n grid where we place some 1 x 1 x 1 cubes that are axis-aligned with the x, y, and z axes.
Each value v = grid[i][j] represents a tower of v cubes placed on top of the cell (i, j).
We view the projection of these cubes onto the xy, yz, and zx planes.
A projection is like a shadow, that maps our 3-dimensional figure to a 2-dimensional plane. We are viewing the "shadow" when looking at the cubes from the top, the front, and the side.
Return the total area of all three projections.
