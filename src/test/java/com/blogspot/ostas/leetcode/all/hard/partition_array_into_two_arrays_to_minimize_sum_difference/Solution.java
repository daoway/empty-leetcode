      2035. partition array into two arrays to minimize sum difference

https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-into-two-arrays-to-minimize-sum-difference

You are given an integer array nums of 2 * n integers. You need to partition nums into two arrays of length n to minimize the absolute difference of the sums of the arrays. To partition nums, put each element of nums into one of the two arrays.
Return the minimum possible absolute difference.
