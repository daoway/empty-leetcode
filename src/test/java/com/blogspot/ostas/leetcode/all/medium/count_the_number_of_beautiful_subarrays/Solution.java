      2588. count the number of beautiful subarrays

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-beautiful-subarrays

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. In one operation, you can:
Choose two different indices i and j such that 0 <= i, j < nums.length.
Choose a non-negative integer k such that the kth bit (0-indexed) in the binary representation of nums[i] and nums[j] is 1.
Subtract 2k from nums[i] and nums[j].
A subarray is beautiful if it is possible to make all of its elements equal to 0 after applying the above operation any number of times.
Return the number of beautiful subarrays in the array nums.
A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.
