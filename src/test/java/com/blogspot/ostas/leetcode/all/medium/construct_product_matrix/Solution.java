      2906. construct product matrix

https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-product-matrix

Given a 0-indexed 2D integer matrix grid of size n * m, we define a 0-indexed 2D matrix p of size n * m as the product matrix of grid if the following condition is met:
Each element p[i][j] is calculated as the product of all elements in grid except for the element grid[i][j]. This product is then taken modulo 12345.
Return the product matrix of grid.
