      1404. number of steps to reduce a number in binary representation to one

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-steps-to-reduce-a-number-in-binary-representation-to-one

Given the binary representation of an integer as a string s, return the number of steps to reduce it to 1 under the following rules:
If the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2.
If the current number is odd, you have to add 1 to it.
It is guaranteed that you can always reach one for all test cases.

class Solution {
  public int numSteps(String s) {
    return 0;
  }
