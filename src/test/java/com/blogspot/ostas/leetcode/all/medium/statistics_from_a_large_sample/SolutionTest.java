      Example 1:
    Input: count = [0,1,3,4,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
    Output: [1.00000,3.00000,2.37500,2.50000,3.00000]
    Explanation: The sample represented by count is [1,2,2,2,3,3,3,3].
    The minimum and maximum are 1 and 3 respectively.
    The mean is (1+2+2+2+3+3+3+3) / 8 = 19 / 8 = 2.375.
    Since the size of the sample is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements 2 and 3, which is 2.5.
    The mode is 3 as it appears the most in the sample.
    Example 2:
    Input: count = [0,4,3,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
    Output: [1.00000,4.00000,2.18182,2.00000,1.00000]
    Explanation: The sample represented by count is [1,1,1,1,2,2,2,3,3,4,4].
    The minimum and maximum are 1 and 4 respectively.
    The mean is (1+1+1+1+2+2+2+3+3+4+4) / 11 = 24 / 11 = 2.18181818... (for display purposes, the output shows the rounded number 2.18182).
    Since the size of the sample is odd, the median is the middle element 2.
    The mode is 1 as it appears the most in the sample.
      Constraints:
    count.length == 256
    0 <= count[i] <= 109
    1 <= sum(count) <= 109
    The mode of the sample that count represents is unique.
