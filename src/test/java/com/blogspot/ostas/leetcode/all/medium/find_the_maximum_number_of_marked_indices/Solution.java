https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-maximum-number-of-marked-indices

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums.
Initially, all of the indices are unmarked. You are allowed to make this operation any number of times:
Pick two different unmarked indices i and j such that 2 * nums[i] <= nums[j], then mark i and j.
Return the maximum possible number of marked indices in nums using the above operation any number of times.
