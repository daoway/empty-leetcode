      2718. sum of matrix after queries

https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-matrix-after-queries

You are given an integer n and a 0-indexed 2D array queries where queries[i] = [typei, indexi, vali].
Initially, there is a 0-indexed n x n matrix filled with 0's. For each query, you must apply one of the following changes:
if typei == 0, set the values in the row with indexi to vali, overwriting any previous values.
if typei == 1, set the values in the column with indexi to vali, overwriting any previous values.
Return the sum of integers in the matrix after all queries are applied.
