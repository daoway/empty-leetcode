      1638. count substrings that differ by one character

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-substrings-that-differ-by-one-character

Given two strings s and t, find the number of ways you can choose a non-empty substring of s and replace a single character by a different character such that the resulting substring is a substring of t. In other words, find the number of substrings in s that differ from some substring in t by exactly one character.
For example, the underlined substrings in "computer" and "computation" only differ by the 'e'/'a', so this is a valid way.
Return the number of substrings that satisfy the condition above.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
