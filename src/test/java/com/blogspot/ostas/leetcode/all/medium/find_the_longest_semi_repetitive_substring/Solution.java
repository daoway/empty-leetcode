      2730. find the longest semi-repetitive substring

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-longest-semi-repetitive-substring

You are given a 0-indexed string s that consists of digits from 0 to 9.
A string t is called a semi-repetitive if there is at most one consecutive pair of the same digits inside t. For example, 0010, 002020, 0123, 2002, and 54944 are semi-repetitive while 00101022, and 1101234883 are not.
Return the length of the longest semi-repetitive substring inside s.
A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.
