      1252. cells with odd values in a matrix

https://leetcode.com/problems/cells-with-odd-values-in-a-matrix

There is an m x n matrix that is initialized to all 0's. There is also a 2D array indices where each indices[i] = [ri, ci] represents a 0-indexed location to perform some increment operations on the matrix.
For each location indices[i], do both of the following:
Increment all the cells on row ri.
Increment all the cells on column ci.
Given m, n, and indices, return the number of odd-valued cells in the matrix after applying the increment to all locations in indices.

  public int oddCells(int m, int n, int[][] indices) {
