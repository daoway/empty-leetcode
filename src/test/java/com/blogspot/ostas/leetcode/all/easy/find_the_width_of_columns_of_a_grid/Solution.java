      2639. find the width of columns of a grid

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-width-of-columns-of-a-grid

You are given a 0-indexed m x n integer matrix grid. The width of a column is the maximum length of its integers.
For example, if grid = [[-10], [3], [12]], the width of the only column is 3 since -10 is of length 3.
Return an integer array ans of size n where ans[i] is the width of the ith column.
The length of an integer x with len digits is equal to len if x is non-negative, and len + 1 otherwise.
