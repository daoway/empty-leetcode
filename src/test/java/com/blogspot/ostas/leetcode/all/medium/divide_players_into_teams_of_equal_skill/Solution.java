https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-players-into-teams-of-equal-skill

You are given a positive integer array skill of even length n where skill[i] denotes the skill of the ith player. Divide the players into n / 2 teams of size 2 such that the total skill of each team is equal.
The chemistry of a team is equal to the product of the skills of the players on that team.
Return the sum of the chemistry of all the teams, or return -1 if there is no way to divide the players into teams such that the total skill of each team is equal.
