      1761. minimum degree of a connected trio in a graph

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-degree-of-a-connected-trio-in-a-graph

You are given an undirected graph. You are given an integer n which is the number of nodes in the graph and an array edges, where each edges[i] = [ui, vi] indicates that there is an undirected edge between ui and vi.
A connected trio is a set of three nodes where there is an edge between every pair of them.
The degree of a connected trio is the number of edges where one endpoint is in the trio, and the other is not.
Return the minimum degree of a connected trio in the graph, or -1 if the graph has no connected trios.
