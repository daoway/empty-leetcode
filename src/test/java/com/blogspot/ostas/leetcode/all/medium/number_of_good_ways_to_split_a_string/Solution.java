      1525. number of good ways to split a string

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-good-ways-to-split-a-string

You are given a string s.
A split is called good if you can split s into two non-empty strings sleft and sright where their concatenation is equal to s (i.e., sleft + sright = s) and the number of distinct letters in sleft and sright is the same.
Return the number of good splits you can make in s.

  public int numSplits(String s) {
    return 0;
