https://leetcode.com/problems/find-palindrome-with-fixed-length

Given an integer array queries and a positive integer intLength, return an array answer where answer[i] is either the queries[i]th smallest positive palindrome of length intLength or -1 if no such palindrome exists.
A palindrome is a number that reads the same backwards and forwards. Palindromes cannot have leading zeros.
