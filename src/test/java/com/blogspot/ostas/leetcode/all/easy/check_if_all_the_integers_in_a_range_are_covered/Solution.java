      1893. check if all the integers in a range are covered

https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-all-the-integers-in-a-range-are-covered

You are given a 2D integer array ranges and two integers left and right. Each ranges[i] = [starti, endi] represents an inclusive interval between starti and endi.
Return true if each integer in the inclusive range [left, right] is covered by at least one interval in ranges. Return false otherwise.
An integer x is covered by an interval ranges[i] = [starti, endi] if starti <= x <= endi.
