https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-add-to-make-parentheses-valid

A parentheses string is valid if and only if:
It is the empty string,
It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or
It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string.
You are given a parentheses string s. In one move, you can insert a parenthesis at any position of the string.
For example, if s = "()))", you can insert an opening parenthesis to be "(()))" or a closing parenthesis to be "())))".
Return the minimum number of moves required to make s valid.
