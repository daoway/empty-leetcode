      1566. detect pattern of length m repeated k or more times

https://leetcode.com/problems/detect-pattern-of-length-m-repeated-k-or-more-times

Given an array of positive integers arr, find a pattern of length m that is repeated k or more times.
A pattern is a subarray (consecutive sub-sequence) that consists of one or more values, repeated multiple times consecutively without overlapping. A pattern is defined by its length and the number of repetitions.
Return true if there exists a pattern of length m that is repeated k or more times, otherwise return false.
