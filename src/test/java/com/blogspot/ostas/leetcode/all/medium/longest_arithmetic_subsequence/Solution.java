      1027. longest arithmetic subsequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-arithmetic-subsequence

Given an array nums of integers, return the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence in nums.
Note that:
A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
A sequence seq is arithmetic if seq[i + 1] - seq[i] are all the same value (for 0 <= i < seq.length - 1).
