https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-elements-in-an-array

You are given a 0-indexed array nums that consists of n distinct positive integers. Apply m operations to this array, where in the ith operation you replace the number operations[i][0] with operations[i][1].
It is guaranteed that in the ith operation:
operations[i][0] exists in nums.
operations[i][1] does not exist in nums.
Return the array obtained after applying all the operations.
