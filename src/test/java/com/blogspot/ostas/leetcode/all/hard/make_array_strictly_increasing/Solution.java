      1187. make array strictly increasing

https://leetcode.com/problems/make-array-strictly-increasing

Given two integer arrays arr1 and arr2, return the minimum number of operations (possibly zero) needed to make arr1 strictly increasing.
In one operation, you can choose two indices 0 <= i < arr1.length and 0 <= j < arr2.length and do the assignment arr1[i] = arr2[j].
If there is no way to make arr1 strictly increasing, return -1.
