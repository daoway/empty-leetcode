      1375. number of times binary string is prefix-aligned

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-times-binary-string-is-prefix-aligned

You have a 1-indexed binary string of length n where all the bits are 0 initially. We will flip all the bits of this binary string (i.e., change them from 0 to 1) one by one. You are given a 1-indexed integer array flips where flips[i] indicates that the bit at index i will be flipped in the ith step.
A binary string is prefix-aligned if, after the ith step, all the bits in the inclusive range [1, i] are ones and all the other bits are zeros.
Return the number of times the binary string is prefix-aligned during the flipping process.
