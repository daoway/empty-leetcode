      1753. maximum score from removing stones

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-score-from-removing-stones

You are playing a solitaire game with three piles of stones of sizes a, b, and c respectively. Each turn you choose two different non-empty piles, take one stone from each, and add 1 point to your score. The game stops when there are fewer than two non-empty piles (meaning there are no more available moves).
Given three integers a, b, and c, return the maximum score you can get.
