      1031. maximum sum of two non-overlapping subarrays

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-sum-of-two-non-overlapping-subarrays

Given an integer array nums and two integers firstLen and secondLen, return the maximum sum of elements in two non-overlapping subarrays with lengths firstLen and secondLen.
The array with length firstLen could occur before or after the array with length secondLen, but they have to be non-overlapping.
A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.
