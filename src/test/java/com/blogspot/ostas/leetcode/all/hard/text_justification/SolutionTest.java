class SolutionTest {

    /*
      Example 1:
    Input: words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."], maxWidth = 16
    Output:
    [
       "This    is    an",
       "example  of text",
       "justification.  "
    ]
    Example 2:
    Input: words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"], maxWidth = 16
    Output:
    [
      "What   must   be",
      "acknowledgment  ",
      "shall be        "
    ]
    Explanation: Note that the last line is "shall be    " instead of "shall     be", because the last line must be left-justified instead of fully-justified.
    Note that the second line is also left-justified because it contains only one word.
    Example 3:
    Input: words = ["Science","is","what","we","understand","well","enough","to","explain","to","a","computer.","Art","is","everything","else","we","do"], maxWidth = 20
    Output:
    [
      "Science  is  what we",
      "understand      well",
      "enough to explain to",
      "a  computer.  Art is",
      "everything  else  we",
      "do                  "
    ]
      Constraints:
    1 <= words.length <= 300
    1 <= words[i].length <= 20
    words[i] consists of only English letters and symbols.
    1 <= maxWidth <= 100
    words[i].length <= maxWidth
