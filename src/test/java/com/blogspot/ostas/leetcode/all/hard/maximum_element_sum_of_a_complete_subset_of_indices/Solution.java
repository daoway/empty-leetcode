      2862. maximum element-sum of a complete subset of indices

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-element-sum-of-a-complete-subset-of-indices

You are given a 1-indexed array nums of n integers.
A set of numbers is complete if the product of every pair of its elements is a perfect square.
For a subset of the indices set {1, 2, ..., n} represented as {i1, i2, ..., ik}, we define its element-sum as: nums[i1] + nums[i2] + ... + nums[ik].
Return the maximum element-sum of a complete subset of the indices set {1, 2, ..., n}.
A perfect square is a number that can be expressed as the product of an integer by itself.
