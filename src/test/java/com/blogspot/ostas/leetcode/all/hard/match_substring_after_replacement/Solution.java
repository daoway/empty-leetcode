      2301. match substring after replacement

https://leetcode.com/problems/match-substring-after-replacement

You are given two strings s and sub. You are also given a 2D character array mappings where mappings[i] = [oldi, newi] indicates that you may perform the following operation any number of times:
Replace a character oldi of sub with newi.
Each character in sub cannot be replaced more than once.
Return true if it is possible to make sub a substring of s by replacing zero or more characters according to mappings. Otherwise, return false.
A substring is a contiguous non-empty sequence of characters within a string.
