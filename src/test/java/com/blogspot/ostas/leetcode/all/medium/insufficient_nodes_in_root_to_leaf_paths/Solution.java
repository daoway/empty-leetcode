      1080. insufficient nodes in root to leaf paths

https://leetcode.com/problems/insufficient-nodes-in-root-to-leaf-paths

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer limit, delete all insufficient nodes in the tree simultaneously, and return the root of the resulting binary tree.
A node is insufficient if every root to leaf path intersecting this node has a sum strictly less than limit.
A leaf is a node with no children.
