https://leetcode.com/problems/reach-a-number

You are standing at position 0 on an infinite number line. There is a destination at position target.
You can make some number of moves numMoves so that:
On each move, you can either go left or right.
During the ith move (starting from i == 1 to i == numMoves), you take i steps in the chosen direction.
Given the integer target, return the minimum number of moves required (i.e., the minimum numMoves) to reach the destination.
