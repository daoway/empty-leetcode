      1562. find latest group of size m

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-latest-group-of-size-m

Given an array arr that represents a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.
You have a binary string of size n that initially has all its bits set to zero. At each step i (assuming both the binary string and arr are 1-indexed) from 1 to n, the bit at position arr[i] is set to 1.
You are also given an integer m. Find the latest step at which there exists a group of ones of length m. A group of ones is a contiguous substring of 1's such that it cannot be extended in either direction.
Return the latest step at which there exists a group of ones of length exactly m. If no such group exists, return -1.
