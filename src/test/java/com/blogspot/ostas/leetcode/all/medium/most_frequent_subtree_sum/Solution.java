https://leetcode.com/problems/most-frequent-subtree-sum

Given the root of a binary tree, return the most frequent subtree sum. If there is a tie, return all the values with the highest frequency in any order.
The subtree sum of a node is defined as the sum of all the node values formed by the subtree rooted at that node (including the node itself).
