https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-replacements-to-sort-the-array

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. In one operation you can replace any element of the array with any two elements that sum to it.
For example, consider nums = [5,6,7]. In one operation, we can replace nums[1] with 2 and 4 and convert nums to [5,2,4,7].
Return the minimum number of operations to make an array that is sorted in non-decreasing order.
