https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-a-uni-value-grid

You are given a 2D integer grid of size m x n and an integer x. In one operation, you can add x to or subtract x from any element in the grid.
A uni-value grid is a grid where all the elements of it are equal.
Return the minimum number of operations to make the grid uni-value. If it is not possible, return -1.
