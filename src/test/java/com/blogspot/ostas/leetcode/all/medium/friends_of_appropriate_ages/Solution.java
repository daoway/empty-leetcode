https://leetcode.com/problems/friends-of-appropriate-ages

There are n persons on a social media website. You are given an integer array ages where ages[i] is the age of the ith person.
A Person x will not send a friend request to a person y (x != y) if any of the following conditions is true:
age[y] <= 0.5 * age[x] + 7
age[y] > age[x]
age[y] > 100 && age[x] < 100
Otherwise, x will send a friend request to y.
Note that if x sends a request to y, y will not necessarily send a request to x. Also, a person will not send a friend request to themself.
Return the total number of friend requests made.
