      2285. maximum total importance of roads

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-total-importance-of-roads

You are given an integer n denoting the number of cities in a country. The cities are numbered from 0 to n - 1.
You are also given a 2D integer array roads where roads[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists a bidirectional road connecting cities ai and bi.
You need to assign each city with an integer value from 1 to n, where each value can only be used once. The importance of a road is then defined as the sum of the values of the two cities it connects.
Return the maximum total importance of all roads possible after assigning the values optimally.
