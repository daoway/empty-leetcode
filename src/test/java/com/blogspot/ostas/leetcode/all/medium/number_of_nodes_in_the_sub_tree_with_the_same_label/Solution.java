      1519. number of nodes in the sub-tree with the same label

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-nodes-in-the-sub-tree-with-the-same-label

You are given a tree (i.e. a connected, undirected graph that has no cycles) consisting of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 and exactly n - 1 edges. The root of the tree is the node 0, and each node of the tree has a label which is a lower-case character given in the string labels (i.e. The node with the number i has the label labels[i]).
The edges array is given on the form edges[i] = [ai, bi], which means there is an edge between nodes ai and bi in the tree.
Return an array of size n where ans[i] is the number of nodes in the subtree of the ith node which have the same label as node i.
A subtree of a tree T is the tree consisting of a node in T and all of its descendant nodes.
