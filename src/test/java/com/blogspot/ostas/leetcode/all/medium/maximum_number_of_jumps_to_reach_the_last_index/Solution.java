      2770. maximum number of jumps to reach the last index

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-number-of-jumps-to-reach-the-last-index

You are given a 0-indexed array nums of n integers and an integer target.
You are initially positioned at index 0. In one step, you can jump from index i to any index j such that:
0 <= i < j < n
-target <= nums[j] - nums[i] <= target
Return the maximum number of jumps you can make to reach index n - 1.
If there is no way to reach index n - 1, return -1.
