      2250. count number of rectangles containing each point

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-rectangles-containing-each-point

You are given a 2D integer array rectangles where rectangles[i] = [li, hi] indicates that ith rectangle has a length of li and a height of hi. You are also given a 2D integer array points where points[j] = [xj, yj] is a point with coordinates (xj, yj).
The ith rectangle has its bottom-left corner point at the coordinates (0, 0) and its top-right corner point at (li, hi).
Return an integer array count of length points.length where count[j] is the number of rectangles that contain the jth point.
The ith rectangle contains the jth point if 0 <= xj <= li and 0 <= yj <= hi. Note that points that lie on the edges of a rectangle are also considered to be contained by that rectangle.
