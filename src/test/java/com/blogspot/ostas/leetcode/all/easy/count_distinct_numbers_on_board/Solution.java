      2549. count distinct numbers on board

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-distinct-numbers-on-board

You are given a positive integer n, that is initially placed on a board. Every day, for 109 days, you perform the following procedure:
For each number x present on the board, find all numbers 1 <= i <= n such that x % i == 1.
Then, place those numbers on the board.
Return the number of distinct integers present on the board after 109 days have elapsed.
Note:
Once a number is placed on the board, it will remain on it until the end.
% stands for the modulo operation. For example, 14 % 3 is 2.
