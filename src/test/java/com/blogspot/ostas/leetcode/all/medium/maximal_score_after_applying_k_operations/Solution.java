      2530. maximal score after applying k operations

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-score-after-applying-k-operations

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums and an integer k. You have a starting score of 0.
In one operation:
choose an index i such that 0 <= i < nums.length,
increase your score by nums[i], and
replace nums[i] with ceil(nums[i] / 3).
Return the maximum possible score you can attain after applying exactly k operations.
The ceiling function ceil(val) is the least integer greater than or equal to val.
