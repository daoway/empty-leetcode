      1217. minimum cost to move chips to the same position

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-move-chips-to-the-same-position

We have n chips, where the position of the ith chip is position[i].
We need to move all the chips to the same position. In one step, we can change the position of the ith chip from position[i] to:
position[i] + 2 or position[i] - 2 with cost = 0.
position[i] + 1 or position[i] - 1 with cost = 1.
Return the minimum cost needed to move all the chips to the same position.
