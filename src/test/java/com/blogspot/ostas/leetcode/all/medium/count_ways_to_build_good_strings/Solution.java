      2466. count ways to build good strings

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-ways-to-build-good-strings

Given the integers zero, one, low, and high, we can construct a string by starting with an empty string, and then at each step perform either of the following:
Append the character '0' zero times.
Append the character '1' one times.
This can be performed any number of times.
A good string is a string constructed by the above process having a length between low and high (inclusive).
Return the number of different good strings that can be constructed satisfying these properties. Since the answer can be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
