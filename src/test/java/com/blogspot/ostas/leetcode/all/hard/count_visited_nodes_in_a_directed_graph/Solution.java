      2876. count visited nodes in a directed graph

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-visited-nodes-in-a-directed-graph

There is a directed graph consisting of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1 and n directed edges.
You are given a 0-indexed array edges where edges[i] indicates that there is an edge from node i to node edges[i].
Consider the following process on the graph:
You start from a node x and keep visiting other nodes through edges until you reach a node that you have already visited before on this same process.
Return an array answer where answer[i] is the number of different nodes that you will visit if you perform the process starting from node i.
