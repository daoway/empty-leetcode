https://leetcode.com/problems/self-crossing

You are given an array of integers distance.
You start at the point (0, 0) on an X-Y plane, and you move distance[0] meters to the north, then distance[1] meters to the west, distance[2] meters to the south, distance[3] meters to the east, and so on. In other words, after each move, your direction changes counter-clockwise.
Return true if your path crosses itself or false if it does not.
