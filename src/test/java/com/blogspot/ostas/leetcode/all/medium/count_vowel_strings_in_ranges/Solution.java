You are given a 0-indexed array of strings words and a 2D array of integers queries.
Each query queries[i] = [li, ri] asks us to find the number of strings present in the range li to ri (both inclusive) of words that start and end with a vowel.
Return an array ans of size queries.length, where ans[i] is the answer to the ith query.
