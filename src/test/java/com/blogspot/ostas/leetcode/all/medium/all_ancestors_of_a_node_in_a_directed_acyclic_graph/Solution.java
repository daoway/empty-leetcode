      2192. all ancestors of a node in a directed acyclic graph

https://leetcode.com/problems/all-ancestors-of-a-node-in-a-directed-acyclic-graph

You are given a positive integer n representing the number of nodes of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). The nodes are numbered from 0 to n - 1 (inclusive).
You are also given a 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] = [fromi, toi] denotes that there is a unidirectional edge from fromi to toi in the graph.
Return a list answer, where answer[i] is the list of ancestors of the ith node, sorted in ascending order.
A node u is an ancestor of another node v if u can reach v via a set of edges.
