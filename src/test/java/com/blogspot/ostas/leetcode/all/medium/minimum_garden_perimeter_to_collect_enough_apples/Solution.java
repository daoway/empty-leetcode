      1954. minimum garden perimeter to collect enough apples

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-garden-perimeter-to-collect-enough-apples

In a garden represented as an infinite 2D grid, there is an apple tree planted at every integer coordinate. The apple tree planted at an integer coordinate (i, j) has |i| + |j| apples growing on it.
You will buy an axis-aligned square plot of land that is centered at (0, 0).
Given an integer neededApples, return the minimum perimeter of a plot such that at least neededApples apples are inside or on the perimeter of that plot.
The value of |x| is defined as:
x if x >= 0
-x if x < 0
