      1604. alert using same key-card three or more times in a one hour period

https://leetcode.com/problems/alert-using-same-key-card-three-or-more-times-in-a-one-hour-period

LeetCode company workers use key-cards to unlock office doors. Each time a worker uses their key-card, the security system saves the worker's name and the time when it was used. The system emits an alert if any worker uses the key-card three or more times in a one-hour period.
You are given a list of strings keyName and keyTime where [keyName[i], keyTime[i]] corresponds to a person's name and the time when their key-card was used in a single day.
Access times are given in the 24-hour time format "HH:MM", such as "23:51" and "09:49".
Return a list of unique worker names who received an alert for frequent keycard use. Sort the names in ascending order alphabetically.
Notice that "10:00" - "11:00" is considered to be within a one-hour period, while "22:51" - "23:52" is not considered to be within a one-hour period.
