      1309. decrypt string from alphabet to integer mapping

https://leetcode.com/problems/decrypt-string-from-alphabet-to-integer-mapping

You are given a string s formed by digits and '#'. We want to map s to English lowercase characters as follows:
Characters ('a' to 'i') are represented by ('1' to '9') respectively.
Characters ('j' to 'z') are represented by ('10#' to '26#') respectively.
Return the string formed after mapping.
The test cases are generated so that a unique mapping will always exist.
