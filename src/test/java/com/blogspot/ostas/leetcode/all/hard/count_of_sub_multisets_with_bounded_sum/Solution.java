      2902. count of sub-multisets with bounded sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-of-sub-multisets-with-bounded-sum

You are given a 0-indexed array nums of non-negative integers, and two integers l and r.
Return the count of sub-multisets within nums where the sum of elements in each subset falls within the inclusive range of [l, r].
Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
A sub-multiset is an unordered collection of elements of the array in which a given value x can occur 0, 1, ..., occ[x] times, where occ[x] is the number of occurrences of x in the array.
Note that:
Two sub-multisets are the same if sorting both sub-multisets results in identical multisets.
The sum of an empty multiset is 0.
