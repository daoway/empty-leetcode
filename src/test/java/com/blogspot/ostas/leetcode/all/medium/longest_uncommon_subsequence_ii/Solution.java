      522. longest uncommon subsequence ii

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-uncommon-subsequence-ii

Given an array of strings strs, return the length of the longest uncommon subsequence between them. If the longest uncommon subsequence does not exist, return -1.
An uncommon subsequence between an array of strings is a string that is a subsequence of one string but not the others.
A subsequence of a string s is a string that can be obtained after deleting any number of characters from s.
For example, "abc" is a subsequence of "aebdc" because you can delete the underlined characters in "aebdc" to get "abc". Other subsequences of "aebdc" include "aebdc", "aeb", and "" (empty string).
