https://leetcode.com/problems/ways-to-express-an-integer-as-sum-of-powers

Given two positive integers n and x.
Return the number of ways n can be expressed as the sum of the xth power of unique positive integers, in other words, the number of sets of unique integers [n1, n2, ..., nk] where n = n1x + n2x + ... + nkx.
Since the result can be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
For example, if n = 160 and x = 3, one way to express n is n = 23 + 33 + 53.
