      1238. circular permutation in binary representation

https://leetcode.com/problems/circular-permutation-in-binary-representation

Given 2 integers n and start. Your task is return any permutation p of (0,1,2.....,2^n -1) such that :
p[0] = start
p[i] and p[i+1] differ by only one bit in their binary representation.
p[0] and p[2^n -1] must also differ by only one bit in their binary representation.
