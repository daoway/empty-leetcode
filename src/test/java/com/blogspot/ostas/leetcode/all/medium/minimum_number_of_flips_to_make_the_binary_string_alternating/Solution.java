      1888. minimum number of flips to make the binary string alternating

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-flips-to-make-the-binary-string-alternating

You are given a binary string s. You are allowed to perform two types of operations on the string in any sequence:
Type-1: Remove the character at the start of the string s and append it to the end of the string.
Type-2: Pick any character in s and flip its value, i.e., if its value is '0' it becomes '1' and vice-versa.
Return the minimum number of type-2 operations you need to perform such that s becomes alternating.
The string is called alternating if no two adjacent characters are equal.
For example, the strings "010" and "1010" are alternating, while the string "0100" is not.
