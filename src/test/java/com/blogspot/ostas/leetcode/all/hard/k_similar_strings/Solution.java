      854. k-similar strings

https://leetcode.com/problems/k-similar-strings

Strings s1 and s2 are k-similar (for some non-negative integer k) if we can swap the positions of two letters in s1 exactly k times so that the resulting string equals s2.
Given two anagrams s1 and s2, return the smallest k for which s1 and s2 are k-similar.

  public int kSimilarity(String s1, String s2) {
    return 0;
