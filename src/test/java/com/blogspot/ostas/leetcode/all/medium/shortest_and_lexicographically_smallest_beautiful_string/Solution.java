      2904. shortest and lexicographically smallest beautiful string

https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-and-lexicographically-smallest-beautiful-string

You are given a binary string s and a positive integer k.
A substring of s is beautiful if the number of 1's in it is exactly k.
Let len be the length of the shortest beautiful substring.
Return the lexicographically smallest beautiful substring of string s with length equal to len. If s doesn't contain a beautiful substring, return an empty string.
A string a is lexicographically larger than a string b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, a has a character strictly larger than the corresponding character in b.
For example, "abcd" is lexicographically larger than "abcc" because the first position they differ is at the fourth character, and d is greater than c.
