      2373. largest local values in a matrix

https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-local-values-in-a-matrix

You are given an n x n integer matrix grid.
Generate an integer matrix maxLocal of size (n - 2) x (n - 2) such that:
maxLocal[i][j] is equal to the largest value of the 3 x 3 matrix in grid centered around row i + 1 and column j + 1.
In other words, we want to find the largest value in every contiguous 3 x 3 matrix in grid.
Return the generated matrix.
