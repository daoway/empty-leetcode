      1621. number of sets of k non-overlapping line segments

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-sets-of-k-non-overlapping-line-segments

Given n points on a 1-D plane, where the ith point (from 0 to n-1) is at x = i, find the number of ways we can draw exactly k non-overlapping line segments such that each segment covers two or more points. The endpoints of each segment must have integral coordinates. The k line segments do not have to cover all n points, and they are allowed to share endpoints.
Return the number of ways we can draw k non-overlapping line segments. Since this number can be huge, return it modulo 109 + 7.
