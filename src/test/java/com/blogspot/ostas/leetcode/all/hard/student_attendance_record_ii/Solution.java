      552. student attendance record ii

https://leetcode.com/problems/student-attendance-record-ii

An attendance record for a student can be represented as a string where each character signifies whether the student was absent, late, or present on that day. The record only contains the following three characters:
'A': Absent.
'L': Late.
'P': Present.
Any student is eligible for an attendance award if they meet both of the following criteria:
The student was absent ('A') for strictly fewer than 2 days total.
The student was never late ('L') for 3 or more consecutive days.
Given an integer n, return the number of possible attendance records of length n that make a student eligible for an attendance award. The answer may be very large, so return it modulo 109 + 7.
