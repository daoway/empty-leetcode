https://leetcode.com/problems/ways-to-make-a-fair-array

You are given an integer array nums. You can choose exactly one index (0-indexed) and remove the element. Notice that the index of the elements may change after the removal.
For example, if nums = [6,1,7,4,1]:
Choosing to remove index 1 results in nums = [6,7,4,1].
Choosing to remove index 2 results in nums = [6,1,4,1].
Choosing to remove index 4 results in nums = [6,1,7,4].
An array is fair if the sum of the odd-indexed values equals the sum of the even-indexed values.
Return the number of indices that you could choose such that after the removal, nums is fair.
