      1671. minimum number of removals to make mountain array

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-removals-to-make-mountain-array

You may recall that an array arr is a mountain array if and only if:
arr.length >= 3
There exists some index i (0-indexed) with 0 < i < arr.length - 1 such that:
arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]
arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]
Given an integer array nums, return the minimum number of elements to remove to make nums a mountain array.
