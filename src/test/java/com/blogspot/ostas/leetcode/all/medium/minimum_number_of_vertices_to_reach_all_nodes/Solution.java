      1557. minimum number of vertices to reach all nodes

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-vertices-to-reach-all-nodes

Given a directed acyclic graph, with n vertices numbered from 0 to n-1, and an array edges where edges[i] = [fromi, toi] represents a directed edge from node fromi to node toi.
Find the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable. It's guaranteed that a unique solution exists.
Notice that you can return the vertices in any order.
