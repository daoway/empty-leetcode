      1223. dice roll simulation

https://leetcode.com/problems/dice-roll-simulation

A die simulator generates a random number from 1 to 6 for each roll. You introduced a constraint to the generator such that it cannot roll the number i more than rollMax[i] (1-indexed) consecutive times.
Given an array of integers rollMax and an integer n, return the number of distinct sequences that can be obtained with exact n rolls. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
Two sequences are considered different if at least one element differs from each other.
