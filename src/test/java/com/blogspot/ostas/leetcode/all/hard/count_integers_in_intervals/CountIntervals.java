      2276. count integers in intervals

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-integers-in-intervals

Given an empty set of intervals, implement a data structure that can:
Add an interval to the set of intervals.
Count the number of integers that are present in at least one interval.
Implement the CountIntervals class:
CountIntervals() Initializes the object with an empty set of intervals.
void add(int left, int right) Adds the interval [left, right] to the set of intervals.
int count() Returns the number of integers that are present in at least one interval.
Note that an interval [left, right] denotes all the integers x where left <= x <= right.

  }

  public int count() {
    return 0;
