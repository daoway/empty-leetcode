      2338. count the number of ideal arrays

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-the-number-of-ideal-arrays

You are given two integers n and maxValue, which are used to describe an ideal array.
A 0-indexed integer array arr of length n is considered ideal if the following conditions hold:
Every arr[i] is a value from 1 to maxValue, for 0 <= i < n.
Every arr[i] is divisible by arr[i - 1], for 0 < i < n.
Return the number of distinct ideal arrays of length n. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
