      1609. even odd tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/even-odd-tree

A binary tree is named Even-Odd if it meets the following conditions:
The root of the binary tree is at level index 0, its children are at level index 1, their children are at level index 2, etc.
For every even-indexed level, all nodes at the level have odd integer values in strictly increasing order (from left to right).
For every odd-indexed level, all nodes at the level have even integer values in strictly decreasing order (from left to right).
Given the root of a binary tree, return true if the binary tree is Even-Odd, otherwise return false.
