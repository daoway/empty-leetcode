      659. split array into consecutive subsequences

https://leetcode.com/problems/split-array-into-consecutive-subsequences

You are given an integer array nums that is sorted in non-decreasing order.
Determine if it is possible to split nums into one or more subsequences such that both of the following conditions are true:
Each subsequence is a consecutive increasing sequence (i.e. each integer is exactly one more than the previous integer).
All subsequences have a length of 3 or more.
Return true if you can split nums according to the above conditions, or false otherwise.
A subsequence of an array is a new array that is formed from the original array by deleting some (can be none) of the elements without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining elements. (i.e., [1,3,5] is a subsequence of [1,2,3,4,5] while [1,3,2] is not).
