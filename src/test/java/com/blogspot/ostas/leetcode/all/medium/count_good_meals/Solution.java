https://leetcode.com/problems/count-good-meals

A good meal is a meal that contains exactly two different food items with a sum of deliciousness equal to a power of two.
You can pick any two different foods to make a good meal.
Given an array of integers deliciousness where deliciousness[i] is the deliciousness of the ith item of food, return the number of different good meals you can make from this list modulo 109 + 7.
Note that items with different indices are considered different even if they have the same deliciousness value.
