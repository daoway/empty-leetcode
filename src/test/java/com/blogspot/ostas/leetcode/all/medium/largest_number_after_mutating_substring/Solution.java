      1946. largest number after mutating substring

https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-number-after-mutating-substring

You are given a string num, which represents a large integer. You are also given a 0-indexed integer array change of length 10 that maps each digit 0-9 to another digit. More formally, digit d maps to digit change[d].
You may choose to mutate a single substring of num. To mutate a substring, replace each digit num[i] with the digit it maps to in change (i.e. replace num[i] with change[num[i]]).
Return a string representing the largest possible integer after mutating (or choosing not to) a single substring of num.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.
