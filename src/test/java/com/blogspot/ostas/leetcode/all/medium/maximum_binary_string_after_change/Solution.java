      1702. maximum binary string after change

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-binary-string-after-change

You are given a binary string binary consisting of only 0's or 1's. You can apply each of the following operations any number of times:
Operation 1: If the number contains the substring "00", you can replace it with "10".
For example, "00010" -> "10010"
Operation 2: If the number contains the substring "10", you can replace it with "01".
For example, "00010" -> "00001"
Return the maximum binary string you can obtain after any number of operations. Binary string x is greater than binary string y if x's decimal representation is greater than y's decimal representation.
