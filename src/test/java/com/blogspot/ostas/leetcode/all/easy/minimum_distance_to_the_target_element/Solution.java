https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-distance-to-the-target-element

Given an integer array nums (0-indexed) and two integers target and start, find an index i such that nums[i] == target and abs(i - start) is minimized. Note that abs(x) is the absolute value of x.
Return abs(i - start).
It is guaranteed that target exists in nums.
