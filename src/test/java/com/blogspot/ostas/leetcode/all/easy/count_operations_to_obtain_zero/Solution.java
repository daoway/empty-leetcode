      2169. count operations to obtain zero

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-operations-to-obtain-zero

You are given two non-negative integers num1 and num2.
In one operation, if num1 >= num2, you must subtract num2 from num1, otherwise subtract num1 from num2.
For example, if num1 = 5 and num2 = 4, subtract num2 from num1, thus obtaining num1 = 1 and num2 = 4. However, if num1 = 4 and num2 = 5, after one operation, num1 = 4 and num2 = 1.
Return the number of operations required to make either num1 = 0 or num2 = 0.
