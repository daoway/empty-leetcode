      1785. minimum elements to add to form a given sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-elements-to-add-to-form-a-given-sum

You are given an integer array nums and two integers limit and goal. The array nums has an interesting property that abs(nums[i]) <= limit.
Return the minimum number of elements you need to add to make the sum of the array equal to goal. The array must maintain its property that abs(nums[i]) <= limit.
Note that abs(x) equals x if x >= 0, and -x otherwise.
