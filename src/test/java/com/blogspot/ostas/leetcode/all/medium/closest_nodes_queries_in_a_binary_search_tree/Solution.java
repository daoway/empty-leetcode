      2476. closest nodes queries in a binary search tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/closest-nodes-queries-in-a-binary-search-tree

You are given the root of a binary search tree and an array queries of size n consisting of positive integers.
Find a 2D array answer of size n where answer[i] = [mini, maxi]:
mini is the largest value in the tree that is smaller than or equal to queries[i]. If a such value does not exist, add -1 instead.
maxi is the smallest value in the tree that is greater than or equal to queries[i]. If a such value does not exist, add -1 instead.
Return the array answer.
