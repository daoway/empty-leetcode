      Example 1:
    Input: grid1 = [[1,1,1,0,0],[0,1,1,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[1,0,0,0,0],[1,1,0,1,1]], grid2 = [[1,1,1,0,0],[0,0,1,1,1],[0,1,0,0,0],[1,0,1,1,0],[0,1,0,1,0]]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: In the picture above, the grid on the left is grid1 and the grid on the right is grid2.
    The 1s colored red in grid2 are those considered to be part of a sub-island. There are three sub-islands.
    Example 2:
    Input: grid1 = [[1,0,1,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1],[0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1],[1,0,1,0,1]], grid2 = [[0,0,0,0,0],[1,1,1,1,1],[0,1,0,1,0],[0,1,0,1,0],[1,0,0,0,1]]
    Output: 2
    Explanation: In the picture above, the grid on the left is grid1 and the grid on the right is grid2.
    The 1s colored red in grid2 are those considered to be part of a sub-island. There are two sub-islands.
      Constraints:
    m == grid1.length == grid2.length
    n == grid1[i].length == grid2[i].length
    1 <= m, n <= 500
    grid1[i][j] and grid2[i][j] are either 0 or 1.
