      1560. most visited sector in a circular track

https://leetcode.com/problems/most-visited-sector-in-a-circular-track

Given an integer n and an integer array rounds. We have a circular track which consists of n sectors labeled from 1 to n. A marathon will be held on this track, the marathon consists of m rounds. The ith round starts at sector rounds[i - 1] and ends at sector rounds[i]. For example, round 1 starts at sector rounds[0] and ends at sector rounds[1]
Return an array of the most visited sectors sorted in ascending order.
Notice that you circulate the track in ascending order of sector numbers in the counter-clockwise direction (See the first example).
