      717. 1-bit and 2-bit characters

https://leetcode.com/problems/1-bit-and-2-bit-characters

We have two special characters:
The first character can be represented by one bit 0.
The second character can be represented by two bits (10 or 11).
Given a binary array bits that ends with 0, return true if the last character must be a one-bit character.
