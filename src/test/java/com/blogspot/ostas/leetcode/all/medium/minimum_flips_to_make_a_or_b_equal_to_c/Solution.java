https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-flips-to-make-a-or-b-equal-to-c

Given 3 positives numbers a, b and c. Return the minimum flips required in some bits of a and b to make ( a OR b == c ). (bitwise OR operation).
Flip operation consists of change any single bit 1 to 0 or change the bit 0 to 1 in their binary representation.
