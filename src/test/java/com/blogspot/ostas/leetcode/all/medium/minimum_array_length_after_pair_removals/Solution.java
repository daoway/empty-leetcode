      2856. minimum array length after pair removals

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-array-length-after-pair-removals

You are given a 0-indexed sorted array of integers nums.
You can perform the following operation any number of times:
Choose two indices, i and j, where i < j, such that nums[i] < nums[j].
Then, remove the elements at indices i and j from nums. The remaining elements retain their original order, and the array is re-indexed.
Return an integer that denotes the minimum length of nums after performing the operation any number of times (including zero).
Note that nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
