https://leetcode.com/problems/rotate-string

Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.
A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.
For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift.

  public boolean rotateString(String s, String goal) {
