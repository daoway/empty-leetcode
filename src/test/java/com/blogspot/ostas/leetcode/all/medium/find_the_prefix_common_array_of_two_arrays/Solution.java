      2657. find the prefix common array of two arrays

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-prefix-common-array-of-two-arrays

You are given two 0-indexed integer permutations A and B of length n.
A prefix common array of A and B is an array C such that C[i] is equal to the count of numbers that are present at or before the index i in both A and B.
Return the prefix common array of A and B.
A sequence of n integers is called a permutation if it contains all integers from 1 to n exactly once.
