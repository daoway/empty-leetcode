      1028. recover a tree from preorder traversal

https://leetcode.com/problems/recover-a-tree-from-preorder-traversal

We run a preorder depth-first search (DFS) on the root of a binary tree.
At each node in this traversal, we output D dashes (where D is the depth of this node), then we output the value of this node.  If the depth of a node is D, the depth of its immediate child is D + 1.  The depth of the root node is 0.
If a node has only one child, that child is guaranteed to be the left child.
Given the output traversal of this traversal, recover the tree and return its root.
