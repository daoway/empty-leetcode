      2531. make number of distinct characters equal

https://leetcode.com/problems/make-number-of-distinct-characters-equal

You are given two 0-indexed strings word1 and word2.
A move consists of choosing two indices i and j such that 0 <= i < word1.length and 0 <= j < word2.length and swapping word1[i] with word2[j].
Return true if it is possible to get the number of distinct characters in word1 and word2 to be equal with exactly one move. Return false otherwise.
