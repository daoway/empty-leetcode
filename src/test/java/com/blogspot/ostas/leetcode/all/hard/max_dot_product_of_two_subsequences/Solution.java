      1458. max dot product of two subsequences

https://leetcode.com/problems/max-dot-product-of-two-subsequences

Given two arrays nums1 and nums2.
Return the maximum dot product between non-empty subsequences of nums1 and nums2 with the same length.
A subsequence of a array is a new array which is formed from the original array by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (ie, [2,3,5] is a subsequence of [1,2,3,4,5] while [1,5,3] is not).
