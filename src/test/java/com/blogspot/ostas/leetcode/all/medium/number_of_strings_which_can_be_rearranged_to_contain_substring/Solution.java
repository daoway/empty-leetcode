      2930. number of strings which can be rearranged to contain substring

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-strings-which-can-be-rearranged-to-contain-substring

You are given an integer n.
A string s is called good if it contains only lowercase English characters and it is possible to rearrange the characters of s such that the new string contains "leet" as a substring.
For example:
The string "lteer" is good because we can rearrange it to form "leetr" .
"letl" is not good because we cannot rearrange it to contain "leet" as a substring.
Return the total number of good strings of length n.
Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.
