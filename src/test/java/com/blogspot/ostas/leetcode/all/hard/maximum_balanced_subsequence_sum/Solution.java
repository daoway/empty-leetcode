      2926. maximum balanced subsequence sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-balanced-subsequence-sum

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums.
A subsequence of nums having length k and consisting of indices i0 < i1 < ... < ik-1 is balanced if the following holds:
nums[ij] - nums[ij-1] >= ij - ij-1, for every j in the range [1, k - 1].
A subsequence of nums having length 1 is considered balanced.
Return an integer denoting the maximum possible sum of elements in a balanced subsequence of nums.
A subsequence of an array is a new non-empty array that is formed from the original array by deleting some (possibly none) of the elements without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining elements.
