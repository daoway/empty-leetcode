      2956. find common elements between two arrays

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-common-elements-between-two-arrays

You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of sizes n and m, respectively.
Consider calculating the following values:
The number of indices i such that 0 <= i < n and nums1[i] occurs at least once in nums2.
The number of indices i such that 0 <= i < m and nums2[i] occurs at least once in nums1.
Return an integer array answer of size 2 containing the two values in the above order.
