      2001. number of pairs of interchangeable rectangles

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-pairs-of-interchangeable-rectangles

You are given n rectangles represented by a 0-indexed 2D integer array rectangles, where rectangles[i] = [widthi, heighti] denotes the width and height of the ith rectangle.
Two rectangles i and j (i < j) are considered interchangeable if they have the same width-to-height ratio. More formally, two rectangles are interchangeable if widthi/heighti == widthj/heightj (using decimal division, not integer division).
Return the number of pairs of interchangeable rectangles in rectangles.
