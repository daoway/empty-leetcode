https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subarray-with-maximum-bitwise-and

You are given an integer array nums of size n.
Consider a non-empty subarray from nums that has the maximum possible bitwise AND.
In other words, let k be the maximum value of the bitwise AND of any subarray of nums. Then, only subarrays with a bitwise AND equal to k should be considered.
Return the length of the longest such subarray.
The bitwise AND of an array is the bitwise AND of all the numbers in it.
A subarray is a contiguous sequence of elements within an array.
