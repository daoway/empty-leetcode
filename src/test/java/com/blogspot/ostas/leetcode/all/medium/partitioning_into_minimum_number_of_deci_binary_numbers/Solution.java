      1689. partitioning into minimum number of deci-binary numbers

https://leetcode.com/problems/partitioning-into-minimum-number-of-deci-binary-numbers

A decimal number is called deci-binary if each of its digits is either 0 or 1 without any leading zeros. For example, 101 and 1100 are deci-binary, while 112 and 3001 are not.
Given a string n that represents a positive decimal integer, return the minimum number of positive deci-binary numbers needed so that they sum up to n.
