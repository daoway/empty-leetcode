      1443. minimum time to collect all apples in a tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-collect-all-apples-in-a-tree

Given an undirected tree consisting of n vertices numbered from 0 to n-1, which has some apples in their vertices. You spend 1 second to walk over one edge of the tree. Return the minimum time in seconds you have to spend to collect all apples in the tree, starting at vertex 0 and coming back to this vertex.
The edges of the undirected tree are given in the array edges, where edges[i] = [ai, bi] means that exists an edge connecting the vertices ai and bi. Additionally, there is a boolean array hasApple, where hasApple[i] = true means that vertex i has an apple; otherwise, it does not have any apple.

class Solution {
  public int minTime(int n, int[][] edges, List<Boolean> hasApple) {
    return 0;
