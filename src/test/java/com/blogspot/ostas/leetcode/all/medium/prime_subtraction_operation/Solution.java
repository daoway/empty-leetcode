      2601. prime subtraction operation

https://leetcode.com/problems/prime-subtraction-operation

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums of length n.
You can perform the following operation as many times as you want:
Pick an index i that you havenâ€™t picked before, and pick a prime p strictly less than nums[i], then subtract p from nums[i].
Return true if you can make nums a strictly increasing array using the above operation and false otherwise.
A strictly increasing array is an array whose each element is strictly greater than its preceding element.
