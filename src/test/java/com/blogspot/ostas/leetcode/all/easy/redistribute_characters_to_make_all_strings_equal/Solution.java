https://leetcode.com/problems/redistribute-characters-to-make-all-strings-equal

You are given an array of strings words (0-indexed).
In one operation, pick two distinct indices i and j, where words[i] is a non-empty string, and move any character from words[i] to any position in words[j].
Return true if you can make every string in words equal using any number of operations, and false otherwise.
