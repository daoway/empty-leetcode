https://leetcode.com/problems/design-graph-with-shortest-path-calculator

There is a directed weighted graph that consists of n nodes numbered from 0 to n - 1. The edges of the graph are initially represented by the given array edges where edges[i] = [fromi, toi, edgeCosti] meaning that there is an edge from fromi to toi with the cost edgeCosti.
Implement the Graph class:
Graph(int n, int[][] edges) initializes the object with n nodes and the given edges.
addEdge(int[] edge) adds an edge to the list of edges where edge = [from, to, edgeCost]. It is guaranteed that there is no edge between the two nodes before adding this one.
int shortestPath(int node1, int node2) returns the minimum cost of a path from node1 to node2. If no path exists, return -1. The cost of a path is the sum of the costs of the edges in the path.
