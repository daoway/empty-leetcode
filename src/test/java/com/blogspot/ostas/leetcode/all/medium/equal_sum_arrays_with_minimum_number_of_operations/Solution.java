      1775. equal sum arrays with minimum number of operations

https://leetcode.com/problems/equal-sum-arrays-with-minimum-number-of-operations

You are given two arrays of integers nums1 and nums2, possibly of different lengths. The values in the arrays are between 1 and 6, inclusive.
In one operation, you can change any integer's value in any of the arrays to any value between 1 and 6, inclusive.
Return the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of values in nums1 equal to the sum of values in nums2. Return -1 if it is not possible to make the sum of the two arrays equal.
