      2672. number of adjacent elements with the same color

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-adjacent-elements-with-the-same-color

There is a 0-indexed array nums of length n. Initially, all elements are uncolored (has a value of 0).
You are given a 2D integer array queries where queries[i] = [indexi, colori].
For each query, you color the index indexi with the color colori in the array nums.
Return an array answer of the same length as queries where answer[i] is the number of adjacent elements with the same color after the ith query.
More formally, answer[i] is the number of indices j, such that 0 <= j < n - 1 and nums[j] == nums[j + 1] and nums[j] != 0 after the ith query.
