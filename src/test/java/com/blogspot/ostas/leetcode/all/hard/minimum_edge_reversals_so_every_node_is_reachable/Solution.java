      2858. minimum edge reversals so every node is reachable

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-edge-reversals-so-every-node-is-reachable

There is a simple directed graph with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1. The graph would form a tree if its edges were bi-directional.
You are given an integer n and a 2D integer array edges, where edges[i] = [ui, vi] represents a directed edge going from node ui to node vi.
An edge reversal changes the direction of an edge, i.e., a directed edge going from node ui to node vi becomes a directed edge going from node vi to node ui.
For every node i in the range [0, n - 1], your task is to independently calculate the minimum number of edge reversals required so it is possible to reach any other node starting from node i through a sequence of directed edges.
Return an integer array answer, where answer[i] is the minimum number of edge reversals required so it is possible to reach any other node starting from node i through a sequence of directed edges.
