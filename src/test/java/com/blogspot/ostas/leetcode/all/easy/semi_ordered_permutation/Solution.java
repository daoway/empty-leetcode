https://leetcode.com/problems/semi-ordered-permutation

You are given a 0-indexed permutation of n integers nums.
A permutation is called semi-ordered if the first number equals 1 and the last number equals n. You can perform the below operation as many times as you want until you make nums a semi-ordered permutation:
Pick two adjacent elements in nums, then swap them.
Return the minimum number of operations to make nums a semi-ordered permutation.
A permutation is a sequence of integers from 1 to n of length n containing each number exactly once.
