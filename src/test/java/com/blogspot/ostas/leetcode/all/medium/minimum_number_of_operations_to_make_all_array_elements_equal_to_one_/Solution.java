      2654. minimum number of operations to make all array elements equal to 1

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-operations-to-make-all-array-elements-equal-to-1

You are given a 0-indexed array nums consisiting of positive integers. You can do the following operation on the array any number of times:
Select an index i such that 0 <= i < n - 1 and replace either of nums[i] or nums[i+1] with their gcd value.
Return the minimum number of operations to make all elements of nums equal to 1. If it is impossible, return -1.
The gcd of two integers is the greatest common divisor of the two integers.
