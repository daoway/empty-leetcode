      1827. minimum operations to make the array increasing

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-operations-to-make-the-array-increasing

You are given an integer array nums (0-indexed). In one operation, you can choose an element of the array and increment it by 1.
For example, if nums = [1,2,3], you can choose to increment nums[1] to make nums = [1,3,3].
Return the minimum number of operations needed to make nums strictly increasing.
An array nums is strictly increasing if nums[i] < nums[i+1] for all 0 <= i < nums.length - 1. An array of length 1 is trivially strictly increasing.
