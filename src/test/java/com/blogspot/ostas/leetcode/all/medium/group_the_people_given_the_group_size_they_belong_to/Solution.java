https://leetcode.com/problems/group-the-people-given-the-group-size-they-belong-to

There are n people that are split into some unknown number of groups. Each person is labeled with a unique ID from 0 to n - 1.
You are given an integer array groupSizes, where groupSizes[i] is the size of the group that person i is in. For example, if groupSizes[1] = 3, then person 1 must be in a group of size 3.
Return a list of groups such that each person i is in a group of size groupSizes[i].
Each person should appear in exactly one group, and every person must be in a group. If there are multiple answers, return any of them. It is guaranteed that there will be at least one valid solution for the given input.
