      2389. longest subsequence with limited sum

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-subsequence-with-limited-sum

You are given an integer array nums of length n, and an integer array queries of length m.
Return an array answer of length m where answer[i] is the maximum size of a subsequence that you can take from nums such that the sum of its elements is less than or equal to queries[i].
A subsequence is an array that can be derived from another array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
