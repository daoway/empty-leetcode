https://leetcode.com/problems/delete-node-in-a-bst

Given a root node reference of a BST and a key, delete the node with the given key in the BST. Return the root node reference (possibly updated) of the BST.
Basically, the deletion can be divided into two stages:
Search for a node to remove.
If the node is found, delete the node.
