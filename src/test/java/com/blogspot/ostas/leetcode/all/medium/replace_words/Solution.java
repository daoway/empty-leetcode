      648. replace words

https://leetcode.com/problems/replace-words

In English, we have a concept called root, which can be followed by some other word to form another longer word - let's call this word successor. For example, when the root "an" is followed by the successor word "other", we can form a new word "another".
Given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence consisting of words separated by spaces, replace all the successors in the sentence with the root forming it. If a successor can be replaced by more than one root, replace it with the root that has the shortest length.
Return the sentence after the replacement.
