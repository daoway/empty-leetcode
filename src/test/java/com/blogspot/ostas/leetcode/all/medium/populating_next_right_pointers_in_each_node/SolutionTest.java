package com.blogspot.ostas.leetcode.all.medium.populating_next_right_pointers_in_each_node;

import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;

class SolutionTest {

    /*
      Example 1:
    Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]
    Output: [1,#,2,3,#,4,5,6,7,#]
    Explanation: Given the above perfect binary tree (Figure A), your function should populate each next pointer to point to its next right node, just like in Figure B. The serialized output is in level order as connected by the next pointers, with '#' signifying the end of each level.
    Example 2:
    Input: root = []
    Output: []
      Constraints:
    The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 212 - 1].
    -1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
      Follow-up:
    You may only use constant extra space.
    The recursive approach is fine. You may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.
