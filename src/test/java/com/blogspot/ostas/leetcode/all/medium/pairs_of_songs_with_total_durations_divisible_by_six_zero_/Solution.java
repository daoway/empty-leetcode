https://leetcode.com/problems/pairs-of-songs-with-total-durations-divisible-by-60

You are given a list of songs where the ith song has a duration of time[i] seconds.
Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by 60. Formally, we want the number of indices i, j such that i < j with (time[i] + time[j]) % 60 == 0.
