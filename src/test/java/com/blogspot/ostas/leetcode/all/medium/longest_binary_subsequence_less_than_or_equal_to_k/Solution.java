      2311. longest binary subsequence less than or equal to k

https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-binary-subsequence-less-than-or-equal-to-k

You are given a binary string s and a positive integer k.
Return the length of the longest subsequence of s that makes up a binary number less than or equal to k.
Note:
The subsequence can contain leading zeroes.
The empty string is considered to be equal to 0.
A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
