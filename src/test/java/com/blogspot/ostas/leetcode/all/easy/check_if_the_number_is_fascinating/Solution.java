https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-the-number-is-fascinating

You are given an integer n that consists of exactly 3 digits.
We call the number n fascinating if, after the following modification, the resulting number contains all the digits from 1 to 9 exactly once and does not contain any 0's:
Concatenate n with the numbers 2 * n and 3 * n.
Return true if n is fascinating, or false otherwise.
Concatenating two numbers means joining them together. For example, the concatenation of 121 and 371 is 121371.
