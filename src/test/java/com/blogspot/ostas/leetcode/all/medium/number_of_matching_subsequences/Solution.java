      792. number of matching subsequences

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-matching-subsequences

Given a string s and an array of strings words, return the number of words[i] that is a subsequence of s.
A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.
For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde".
