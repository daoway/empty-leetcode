      1674. minimum moves to make array complementary

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-moves-to-make-array-complementary

You are given an integer array nums of even length n and an integer limit. In one move, you can replace any integer from nums with another integer between 1 and limit, inclusive.
The array nums is complementary if for all indices i (0-indexed), nums[i] + nums[n - 1 - i] equals the same number. For example, the array [1,2,3,4] is complementary because for all indices i, nums[i] + nums[n - 1 - i] = 5.
Return the minimum number of moves required to make nums complementary.
