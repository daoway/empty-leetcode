      979. distribute coins in binary tree

https://leetcode.com/problems/distribute-coins-in-binary-tree

You are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes where each node in the tree has node.val coins. There are n coins in total throughout the whole tree.
In one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to another. A move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.
Return the minimum number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin.
