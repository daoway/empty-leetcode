      1915. number of wonderful substrings

https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-wonderful-substrings

A wonderful string is a string where at most one letter appears an odd number of times.
For example, "ccjjc" and "abab" are wonderful, but "ab" is not.
Given a string word that consists of the first ten lowercase English letters ('a' through 'j'), return the number of wonderful non-empty substrings in word. If the same substring appears multiple times in word, then count each occurrence separately.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters in a string.
