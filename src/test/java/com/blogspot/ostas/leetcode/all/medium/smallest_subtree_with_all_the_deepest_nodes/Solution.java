      865. smallest subtree with all the deepest nodes

https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-subtree-with-all-the-deepest-nodes

Given the root of a binary tree, the depth of each node is the shortest distance to the root.
Return the smallest subtree such that it contains all the deepest nodes in the original tree.
A node is called the deepest if it has the largest depth possible among any node in the entire tree.
The subtree of a node is a tree consisting of that node, plus the set of all descendants of that node.
