    /*
      Example 1:
    Input
    ["Solution", "pick", "pick", "pick"]
    [[[1, 2, 3, 3, 3]], [3], [1], [3]]
    Output
    [null, 4, 0, 2]

    Explanation
    Solution solution = new Solution([1, 2, 3, 3, 3]);
    solution.pick(3); // It should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. Each index should have equal probability of returning.
    solution.pick(1); // It should return 0. Since in the array only nums[0] is equal to 1.
    solution.pick(3); // It should return either index 2, 3, or 4 randomly. Each index should have equal probability of returning.
      Constraints:
    1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 104
    -231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
    target is an integer from nums.
    At most 104 calls will be made to pick.
