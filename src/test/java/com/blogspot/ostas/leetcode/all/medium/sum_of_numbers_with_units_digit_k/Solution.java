https://leetcode.com/problems/sum-of-numbers-with-units-digit-k

Given two integers num and k, consider a set of positive integers with the following properties:
The units digit of each integer is k.
The sum of the integers is num.
Return the minimum possible size of such a set, or -1 if no such set exists.
Note:
The set can contain multiple instances of the same integer, and the sum of an empty set is considered 0.
The units digit of a number is the rightmost digit of the number.
