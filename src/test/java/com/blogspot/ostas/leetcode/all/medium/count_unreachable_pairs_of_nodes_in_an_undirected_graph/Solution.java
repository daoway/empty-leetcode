      2316. count unreachable pairs of nodes in an undirected graph

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-unreachable-pairs-of-nodes-in-an-undirected-graph

You are given an integer n. There is an undirected graph with n nodes, numbered from 0 to n - 1. You are given a 2D integer array edges where edges[i] = [ai, bi] denotes that there exists an undirected edge connecting nodes ai and bi.
Return the number of pairs of different nodes that are unreachable from each other.
