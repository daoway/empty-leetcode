https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-stones-to-minimize-the-total

You are given a 0-indexed integer array piles, where piles[i] represents the number of stones in the ith pile, and an integer k. You should apply the following operation exactly k times:
Choose any piles[i] and remove floor(piles[i] / 2) stones from it.
Notice that you can apply the operation on the same pile more than once.
Return the minimum possible total number of stones remaining after applying the k operations.
floor(x) is the greatest integer that is smaller than or equal to x (i.e., rounds x down).
