      2369. check if there is a valid partition for the array

https://leetcode.com/problems/check-if-there-is-a-valid-partition-for-the-array

You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums. You have to partition the array into one or more contiguous subarrays.
We call a partition of the array valid if each of the obtained subarrays satisfies one of the following conditions:
The subarray consists of exactly 2, equal elements. For example, the subarray [2,2] is good.
The subarray consists of exactly 3, equal elements. For example, the subarray [4,4,4] is good.
The subarray consists of exactly 3 consecutive increasing elements, that is, the difference between adjacent elements is 1. For example, the subarray [3,4,5] is good, but the subarray [1,3,5] is not.
Return true if the array has at least one valid partition. Otherwise, return false.
