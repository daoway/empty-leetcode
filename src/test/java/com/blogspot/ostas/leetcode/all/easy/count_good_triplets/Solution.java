      1534. count good triplets

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-good-triplets

Given an array of integers arr, and three integers a, b and c. You need to find the number of good triplets.
A triplet (arr[i], arr[j], arr[k]) is good if the following conditions are true:
0 <= i < j < k < arr.length
|arr[i] - arr[j]| <= a
|arr[j] - arr[k]| <= b
|arr[i] - arr[k]| <= c
Where |x| denotes the absolute value of x.
Return the number of good triplets.
