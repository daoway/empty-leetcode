      1673. find the most competitive subsequence

https://leetcode.com/problems/find-the-most-competitive-subsequence

Given an integer array nums and a positive integer k, return the most competitive subsequence of nums of size k.
An array's subsequence is a resulting sequence obtained by erasing some (possibly zero) elements from the array.
We define that a subsequence a is more competitive than a subsequence b (of the same length) if in the first position where a and b differ, subsequence a has a number less than the corresponding number in b. For example, [1,3,4] is more competitive than [1,3,5] because the first position they differ is at the final number, and 4 is less than 5.
