      1071. greatest common divisor of strings

https://leetcode.com/problems/greatest-common-divisor-of-strings

For two strings s and t, we say "t divides s" if and only if s = t + ... + t (i.e., t is concatenated with itself one or more times).
Given two strings str1 and str2, return the largest string x such that x divides both str1 and str2.
