      Example 1:
    Input: nums = [1,5,4,2,9,9,9], k = 3
    Output: 15
    Explanation: The subarrays of nums with length 3 are:
    - [1,5,4] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 10.
    - [5,4,2] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 11.
    - [4,2,9] which meets the requirements and has a sum of 15.
    - [2,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is repeated.
    - [9,9,9] which does not meet the requirements because the element 9 is repeated.
    We return 15 because it is the maximum subarray sum of all the subarrays that meet the conditions
    Example 2:
    Input: nums = [4,4,4], k = 3
    Output: 0
    Explanation: The subarrays of nums with length 3 are:
    - [4,4,4] which does not meet the requirements because the element 4 is repeated.
    We return 0 because no subarrays meet the conditions.
      Constraints:
    1 <= k <= nums.length <= 105
    1 <= nums[i] <= 105
