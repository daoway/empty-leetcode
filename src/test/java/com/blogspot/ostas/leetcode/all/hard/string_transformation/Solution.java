      2851. string transformation

https://leetcode.com/problems/string-transformation

You are given two strings s and t of equal length n. You can perform the following operation on the string s:
Remove a suffix of s of length l where 0 < l < n and append it at the start of s.
For example, let s = 'abcd' then in one operation you can remove the suffix 'cd' and append it in front of s making s = 'cdab'.
You are also given an integer k. Return the number of ways in which s can be transformed into t in exactly k operations.
Since the answer can be large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
