      2249. count lattice points inside a circle

https://leetcode.com/problems/count-lattice-points-inside-a-circle

Given a 2D integer array circles where circles[i] = [xi, yi, ri] represents the center (xi, yi) and radius ri of the ith circle drawn on a grid, return the number of lattice points that are present inside at least one circle.
Note:
A lattice point is a point with integer coordinates.
Points that lie on the circumference of a circle are also considered to be inside it.
