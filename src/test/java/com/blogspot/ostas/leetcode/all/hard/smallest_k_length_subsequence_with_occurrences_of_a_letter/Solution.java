      2030. smallest k-length subsequence with occurrences of a letter

https://leetcode.com/problems/smallest-k-length-subsequence-with-occurrences-of-a-letter

You are given a string s, an integer k, a letter letter, and an integer repetition.
Return the lexicographically smallest subsequence of s of length k that has the letter letter appear at least repetition times. The test cases are generated so that the letter appears in s at least repetition times.
A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.
A string a is lexicographically smaller than a string b if in the first position where a and b differ, string a has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in b.
