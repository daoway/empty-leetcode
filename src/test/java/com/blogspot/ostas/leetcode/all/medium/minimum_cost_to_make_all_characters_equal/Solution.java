      2712. minimum cost to make all characters equal

https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-to-make-all-characters-equal

You are given a 0-indexed binary string s of length n on which you can apply two types of operations:
Choose an index i and invert all characters from index 0 to index i (both inclusive), with a cost of i + 1
Choose an index i and invert all characters from index i to index n - 1 (both inclusive), with a cost of n - i
Return the minimum cost to make all characters of the string equal.
Invert a character means if its value is '0' it becomes '1' and vice-versa.
